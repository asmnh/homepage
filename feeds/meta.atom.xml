&lt;p&gt;It's been a while since I've got any channel to braindump whatever's on my mind in relation to coding. Having a bit more time on my hands and getting (again) into some casual messing around with tech, it seems like a good idea to have more structured way of tracking what I'm up to.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don't expect too much activity from myself here - unless something is interesting enough to write about it for future reference or in hope it can reach someone who might be stuck on similar problems. Except... given most stuff I find interesting is somewhere between "extremely niche" and "why would you even bother", usefulness part might be questionable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This post will get updated when I'm done with Github Pages setup, doing quick rundown over how easy publishing works and what you can do with it.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="Meta"></category><category term="github"></category></entry></feed>
