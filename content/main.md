Summary: Bootstrap mental vomit channel

## So here we go... again
It's been a while since I've got any channel to braindump whatever's on my mind in relation to coding. Having a bit more time on my hands and getting (again) into some casual messing around with tech, it seems like a good idea to have more structured way of tracking what I'm up to.

I don't expect too much activity from myself here - unless something is interesting enough to write about it for future reference or in hope it can reach someone who might be stuck on similar problems. Except... given most stuff I find interesting is somewhere between "extremely niche" and "why would you even bother", usefulness part might be questionable.

This post will get updated when I'm done with Github Pages setup, doing quick rundown over how easy publishing works and what you can do with it.
